# RMarkdown Article Template

A very simple article template for [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). It uses [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/) and [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) fonts (you can easily change them), British English spelling, `darkblue` colour for links, double spacing, back references, and numbered sections. The template also has pre-formatted entries for article abstracts, keywords, and [JEL classification codes](https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/jelCodes.php?view=jel). Check out [the example code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danilofreire/rmarkdown-article-template/master/article.Rmd) and [the pdf output](https://github.com/danilofreire/rmarkdown-article-template/blob/master/article.pdf) to see how it looks like. You will need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (and the [rmarkdown package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown)), [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), and a [TeX system](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) to compile the pdf.
